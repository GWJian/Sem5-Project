# NYC Airbnb Analysis - 2019 Data Exploration

This project explores Airbnb listings in New York City using the AB_NYC_2019 dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, mapping neighborhood group room types, identifying top areas in NYC, calculating average room type prices, and more.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the data's accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis.
2. **Neighborhood Group and Room Type Distribution**: Visualizing how neighborhood groups and room types are distributed across the dataset.
3. **Room Types by Location**: Creating an interactive map to explore the prevalence of different room types in various neighborhoods.
4. **Top 10 NYC Areas**: Identifying the ten most popular areas for Airbnb listings.
5. **Average Room Type Prices**: Providing insights into the average price for each room type across the dataset.
6. **Top 10 Most Expensive and Cheapest Neighborhoods**: Uncovering the most and least expensive neighborhoods based on listing prices.
