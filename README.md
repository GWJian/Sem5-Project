## Title: NYC Airbnb Analysis - 2019 Data Exploration

## Description:
This project delves into the fascinating world of Airbnb listings in New York City using the AB_NYC_2019 dataset. It explores various aspects of these listings, including:

Data Cleaning: Techniques employed to ensure the data's accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis.
Neighborhood Group and Room Type Distribution: Visualization of how neighborhood groups and room types are distributed across the dataset.
Room Types by Location: Interactive map (consider using libraries like Folium or Plotly) to explore the prevalence of different room types in various neighborhoods.
Top 10 NYC Areas: Identification of the ten most popular areas for Airbnb listings.
Average Room Type Prices: Insights into the average price for each room type across the dataset.
Top 10 Most Expensive and Cheapest Neighborhoods: Uncovering the most and least expensive neighborhoods based on listing prices.
Price Range Visualization: Creation of a map (consider using libraries like Folium or Plotly) where neighborhoods are colored based on their average price range.

Getting Started:
Clone or Download the Repository:

If using Git: git clone [https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git](https://github.com/GWJian/Sem5-Project.git)
